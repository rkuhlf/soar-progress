# SOAR Progress

<!-- TODO: Add link to website -->

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repo by running `git clone https://github.com/rkuhlf/soar-progress.git` in the command line.

1. Run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies for the project.

1. Run `npm run dev` in the command line to start the development server. 

## Editing the Project
1. Make the edits on your local version of your project.

1. Add the files you want to commit in the version control on the left.

1. Commit and push the changes for them to be propagated into the cloud version.

Note: You should also fetch the project periodically. I think that VS Code has a button that does that.
